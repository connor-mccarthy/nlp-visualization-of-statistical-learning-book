> HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) on the text of the canonical machine learning books "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" and "The Elements of Statistical Learning".

[_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_](http://trevorhastie.github.io/ISLR/) was one of my first technical introductions to machine learning. [_The Elements of Statistical Learning_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) is the more technical treatment of similar topics. This repository contains code and figures related to an statistical investigation of both books using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm.
